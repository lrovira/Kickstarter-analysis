The Outcomes Based on Goal chart first demonstrates that the lower the goal is set to, there is a higher chance of success, except for goals between 35000 and 45000 where a percentage of success is reached again. It is also noticed in the chart that there is a risk of percentage failed to be reached when goal is higher that 45000 where it falls to 0% success. Based on this Lois should focus the goal between 35000 and 45000 to have a high, stable and successful percentage.

The chart of Outcomes Based on Launch Date illustrates that at the beginning of the year the line of successful outcomes starts at a medium success rate with a low increase during February but it quickly comes back down by March. However, starting on March to May we see a drastic increase in the successful line where it reaches its highest peak by the month of May. This can be due to the weather changes and the start of summer vacations for families during the month of May. From that point on the successful outcomes start to slowly decrease reaching its lowest point during the winter months specifically December. This lower successful outcome can be due to the Christmas holidays expenditures that families tend to go through in the months of November and December where families tend to spend more than usual. Based on this analysis my recommendations for the parent category is to take an aggressive strategy starting in the month of March to continue up to August where kids return to school and there is a clear decrease in the successful outcome by that point.
