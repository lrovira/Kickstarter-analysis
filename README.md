The Outcomes Based on Goal chart first demonstrates that the lower the goal is set to, there is a higher chance of success, except for goals between 35000 and 45000 where a percentage of success is reached again. It is also noticed in the chart that there is a risk of percentage failed to be reached when goal is higher that 45000 where it falls to 0% success. Based on this Lois should focus the goal between 35000 and 45000 to have a high, stable and successful percentage.
